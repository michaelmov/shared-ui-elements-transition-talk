#### Google Material Design Guidelines
Navigation transitions use motion to guide users between two screens in your app. They **help users orient themselves by expressing your appâ€™s hierarchy, using movement to indicate how elements are related to one another**.

For example, when an element expands to fill the entire screen, the act of expansion expresses that the new screen is a child element. The screen from which it expanded is its parent element.
